# Poker Calculator
This is a demo that 'calculates' the poker winning hand between 2 players through algorithms. It may not be optimum, but it's for academic purposes.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation
It requires no other installation than having JDK (Java 8 minimum).

### Built with
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was the code editor used for this, so it requires extensions from [Java Extension Pack](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial): https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack.

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) was used for scaffolding this project, specifically Maven Archetype Quickstart for Java 8.

### Usage
The process is simple, once is run, it will ask for the pokerdata.txt source directory and then, for the poker_results.txt target directory (pokerdata.txt was added as an example for file format).

Unit tests are included.

### Bear-in-mind
As Visual Studio Code Output Console cannot receive inputs, it's necessary to add this:

```json
"console": "integratedTerminal"
```

To launch.json file, to use the Integrated Terminal.

Other ways to run/debug this is up to you.
